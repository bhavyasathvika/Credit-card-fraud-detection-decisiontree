Credit card fraud detection using Decision Tree Algorithm.


Credit card fraud is a sober and major growing problem in banking industries. With the advent of the rise of many web services provided by banks, banking frauds are also on the increase. Banking systems always have a strapping security system in order to detect and prevent fraudulent activities of any category of transactions.
Totally eliminating banking fraud is almost unfeasible, but we can however minimize the frauds and prevent them from happening by machine learning techniques like Data Mining. It represents how to utilize these data and find useful information from data has become an urgent need for detection of fraud.
Therefore, data mining technology has become an effective method for detection of fraud. Thus, we are developing a fraud detection system for credit cards using a decision tree induction algorithm for security using Data Mining Technique.
